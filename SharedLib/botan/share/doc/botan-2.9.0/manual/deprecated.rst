Deprecated Features
========================

The following functionality is currently deprecated, and will likely
be removed in a future release. If you think you have a good reason to
be using one of the following, contact the developers to explain your
use case if you want to make sure your code continues to work.

This is in addition to specific API calls marked with BOTAN_DEPRECATED
in the source.

- Directly accessing the member variables of types calendar_point, ASN1_Attribute,
  AlgorithmIdentifier, and BER_Object

- The headers ``botan.h``, ``init.h``, ``lookup.h``, ``threefish.h``, ``sm2_enc.h``

- All or nothing package transform (``package.h``)

- The TLS constructors taking `std::function` for callbacks. Instead
  use the TLS::Callbacks interface.

- Using ``X509_Certificate::subject_info`` and ``issuer_info`` to access any
  information that is not included in the DN or subject alternative name. Prefer
  using the specific assessor functions for other data, eg instead of
  ``cert.subject_info("X509.Certificate.serial")`` use ``cert.serial_number()``.

- The Buffered_Computation base class. In a future release the class will be
  removed, and all of member functions instead declared directly on
  MessageAuthenticationCode and HashFunction. So this only affects you if you
  are directly referencing `Botan::Buffered_Computation` in some way.
